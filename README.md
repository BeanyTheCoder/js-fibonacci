# JS Fibonacci Sequence ‚ûï

Code that generates and visualizes the fibonacci sequence, which goes by the formula:

$$ Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 $$

What this means is for a given number in the sequence, you get that number by adding the 2 numbers before it.

snippet of the sequence: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5`

2 is gotten from 1 + 1,

3 is gotten from 1 + 2,

5 is gotten from 2 + 3,

## Features ‚ú®

- Visualization of the fibonacci sequence, using a vertical bar graph, where the length and color of the bars represents a number in the sequence.

- Ability to generate a single number from the sequence, or the sequence itself(given a range)
